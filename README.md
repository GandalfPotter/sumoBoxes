# sumoBoxes
This is my first game made using graphics.<br>
It is made with Opengl and Glfw.<br>
I am somewhat new to game development and coding so all feedback is welcome.<br>

# Game
Note:<br>
This is also in the console output of the game and I think it would be useful here too.<br>
<br>   
sumo boxing!<br>
rules:<br>
try to knock the other player into the edge of the screen<br>
<br>
controls:<br>
[W,A,S,D] for player 1 movement\narrow keys for player 2 movement\n[ESC] quit<br>
<br>

-You must spam the key to move without stopping<br>
-The window doesnt resize and will look stretched or squashed depending on user's screen resolution.
<br>
